        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>
            greetings, this is a part of the website designed for introducing myself and a little bit of an overview about this
            project. i am currently pursuing computer science as my major and am a junior at college. </p>
        
        <p> i love the field i am currently studying at college. something about computer science makes me want to learn more concepts
            and apply them. an example of this habit of mine is this very website.
        </p>
        <p> i am currently working as a research intern at HRI laboratory on campus. This extremely insightful position has me currently working 
            with simulated robots using ros2, c++, python, and bash. I maintain my source workflow using git.
        </p>
        <p> i am looking to take part in cs related activities such as hackathons and programming competitions.</p>
        <p>i will try my best to work on new and meaningful projects to elevate my resume and make memorable, useful, and long lasting software.</p>
