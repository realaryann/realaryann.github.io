        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>
            greetings, this is a part of the website designed for introducing myself and a little bit of an overview about this
            project. i am currently pursuing computer science as my major and am a freshman at college. </p>

        <p> i love the field i am currently studying at college. something about computer science makes me want to learn more concepts
            and apply them. an example of this habit of mine is this very website.
        </p>
        <p> i am currently focusing on data structures and algorithms. i feel quite intrigued to learn new algorithms. next logical step would 
            be to implement all my data structure knowledge in python.
        </p>
        <p> i am looking to take part in cs related activities such as hackathons and programming competitions.</p>
        <p>i will try my best to work on new and meaningful projects to elevate my resume and make memorable and useful software.</p>
