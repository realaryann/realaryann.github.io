            <div><h2>evil hangman</h2>
                <p>A game created as a part of my data structures class, it plays the game of hangman using a dictionary with thousands of words
                    but is "evil" because it keeps swapping the word displayed with another random word of the same length with each guessed letter.
                    The program uses data structures like vectors, binary search trees, generic vectors. written entirely in a linux environment using
                    vi 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div><h2>this website!</h2>
                <p>my first attempt at doing something meaningful with newly acquired HTML and CSS skills. the website is static in nature
                    however may update and become more interactive as and when i begin javascripting.

            <div><h2>high school database</h2>
                <p>one of my first projects which operates in the command line using native python. it is capable of adding a student and his or her
                    grades to a database (for now, a python dictionary). removing them from the database, and altering their grades in the database.
                    i will get back to this project and try to add ui elements to it.
                </p>

                    a medieval age and had certain open world elements to it.
