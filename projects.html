                <p>
                    ‚Ä¢Currently developing a C++ Clone of the popular retro game Pac-Man.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢Pace-Man uses a polymorphic approach to tile based games, in which every tile that appears is a variation of a blank tile.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢Currenly, a Red and Blue ghost exist as the chasers. Red moves in a random open direction.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢Player character can collect candies to increase the score and has 3 lives as displayed in the HUD below.

                <p>
                    ‚Ä¢currently developing a c++ open-source pac-man clone game, available for download via github.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢wrote and implemented a complete map, scoring system, health system, and movement for characters.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢used an object-oriented methodology to implement all tiles on the screen, with polymorphic functions for control at runtime.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢designed a start menu and game over screen, used event driven model to restart the game at any point in time.

                <p>
                    ‚Ä¢currently developing a desktop app that takes in a movie or show as input and provides user with specified number of recommendations.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢fasterBoxd uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from LetterBoxd and Rotten Tomatoes by parsing the HTML.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢app records the inputs by turning them into movie and show objects and storing them into binary/pickle files so that
                     subsequent similar queries could be faster and work offline.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢fasterBoxd would also allow the user to log movies or shows they have seen in a unique file generated for them.

            <div><h2>evil hangman</h2>
                <p>A game created as a part of my data structures class, it plays the game of hangman using a dictionary with thousands of words
                    but is "evil" because it keeps swapping the word displayed with another random word of the same length with each guessed letter.
                    The program uses data structures like vectors, binary search trees, generic vectors. written entirely in a linux environment using
                    vi
