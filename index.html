            <p class="homeabout">this website is a centralized storage for anything i feel is important to document, or log. 
                the website will act as a host for my resume aswell as the current and previous projects I have worked on 
                through my computer science degree.
                <br><br>
                the website is also an effort from a beginner at web development to get accustomed 
                to working on larger projects. 
                <br><br>
                the rate at which this website will get updates is dependant on the number of memorable projects or big things i 
                end up working on. both are directly proportional.
                <br><br>
                the aesthetical design of the website focuses towards minimalism.
