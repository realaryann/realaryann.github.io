            <h2 id="info1head">[5/30/24] scope of blending robotics with data science models</h2>
            <div id="info1">Both the fields of robotics and data science are growing at an exponential rate, so much so that now it almost feels like general
                computing/computer science has become redundant and a general expectation for every candidate, whether it may be for a position within academia 
                or the industry. Working as a student researcher within human-robot interaction has widened my horizon on the true capabilities of robotics and 
                the potential that is currently untapped. I had a fleeting thought about blending the fields of data science and robotics through the creation of
                robots capable of using LLMS to make decisions. As an example, a path detection robot could use a trained data model to know what a pitfall or 
                obstacle would look like, this could make the robot successfully avoid obstacles of various types or of a particular type rather than reading in 
                data from a laser scan and making the robot avoid everything or only certain things.

            <h2 id="info1head">[07/05/23] what piece of tech should we learn next?</h2>
            <div id="info1"> As a new developer and student, it is quite overwhelming to choose a single niche. There is a lot of hype around frontend and
                web development for new graduates due to there being more opportunities in that niche for new devs. I personally was
                entirely captivated and sold on backend development. My first university level course taught me how to deal with memory in a computer,
                which was quite fascinating. The beautiful language of C is the definitive programming language. It was the second language i learned,
                but i wish it was the first one you did. C teaches a person that they have responsibilites, and that they must uphold those responsibilities
                to prevent disaster from striking. If you take memory from the heap, it is your job to return it back when you're done. I did learn HTML 
                and CSS but am currently at the crossroads of whether I should learn javascript or rust. One of these languages would allow me to create 
                alluring web apps for hackathons, but the other has been a passion language of mine and is closer to the field I love-backend. It truly is 
                hard to choose, but choose we must.

            <h2 id="info1head">[06/14/23] fleeting thoughts about the future</h2>
            <div id="info1">With all the major improvements in tech in the past year, future for a traditional programmer is looking bleak.
                In my opinion, and in the most unbiased and realest way, I must say that we are not away until people start depending 
                on NLP generated code for production level applications. As AI tools continue to rise and build upon themselves, it looks
                like the roles for current CS students that guarantee a safe future are those relating to devops and managing positions.
                The only safeguard, right now, is us ourselves. Similar to the lore of a beautiful movie, Dune. In that movie, there was a 
                collective disregard of advancing tech by all the lifeforms of the universe, because they chose themselves over the computer.
                This led to an almost primitive-like-future where the entire landscape of technology changed. Drawing comparisions, what we could
                do is put holds and checks on the development of such NLP applications, such that their usage exists, but the usage exists to
                aid the human, instead of replacing the human.
