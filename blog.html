            <div id="info1">With all the major improvements in tech in the past year, future for a traditional programmer is looking bleak.
                In my opinion, and in the most unbiased and realest way, I must say that we are not away until people start depending 
                on NLP generated code for production level applications. As AI tools continue to rise and build upon themselves, it looks
                like the roles for current CS students that guarantee a safe future are those relating to devops and managing positions.
                The only safeguard, right now, is us ourselves. Similar to the lore of a beautiful movie, Dune. In that movie, there was a 
                collective disregard of advancing tech by all the lifeforms of the universe, because they chose themselves over the computer.
                This led to an almost primitive-like-future where the entire landscape of technology changed. Drawing comparisions, what we could
                do is put holds and checks on the development of such NLP applications, such that their usage exists, but the usage exists to
                aid the human, instead of replacing the human.
